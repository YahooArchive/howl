    <title>Howl Command Line Interface</title>
  </header>
  <body>

<!-- ==================================================================== -->
<section>
	<title>Set Up</title>
  <p>The Howl command line interface (CLI) can be invoked as <code>howl</code> from within the <code>bin</code> directory of the Howl distribution.</p>


<p><strong>Authentication</strong></p>
<table>
	<tr>
	<td><p>If a failure results in a message like "2010-11-03 16:17:28,225 WARN hive.metastore ... - Unable to connect metastore with URI thrift://..." in /tmp/&lt;username&gt;/hive.log, then make sure you have run "kinit &lt;username&gt;@&lt;YOUR KERBEROS KEY DISTRIBUTOR&gt;" to get a kerberos ticket and to be able to authenticate to the Howl server. </p></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>If other errors occur while using the Howl CLI, more detailed messages (if any) are written to /tmp/&lt;username&gt;/hive.log. </p>

<section>
<title>Howl CLI</title>

<p>The Howl CLI supports these command line options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>-g</strong>: Usage is -g mygroup .... This indicates to Howl that table that needs to be created must have group as "mygroup" </li>
<li><strong>-p</strong>: Usage is -p rwxr-xr-x .... This indicates to Howl that table that needs to be created must have permissions as "rwxr-xr-x" </li>
<li><strong>-f</strong>: Usage is -f myscript.howl .... This indicates to howl that myscript.howl is a file which contains DDL commands it needs to execute. </li>
<li><strong>-e</strong>: Usage is -e 'create table mytable(a int);' .... This indicates to Howl to treat the following string as DDL command and execute it. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>	
<p>Note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>-g</strong> and <strong>-p</strong> options are not mandatory. 
</li>
<li>Only the <strong>-e</strong> or <strong>-f</strong> option can be provided, not both. 
</li>
<li>The order of options is immaterial; you can specify the options in any order. 
</li>
<li>If no option is provided, then a usage message is printed: 
<source>
Usage: howl  { -e "&lt;query&gt;" | -f "&lt;filepath&gt;" } [-g "&lt;group&gt;" ] [-p "&lt;perms&gt;"]
</source>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Assumptions</strong></p>
<p>When using the Howl CLI, you cannot specify a permission string without read permissions for owner, such as -wxrwxr-x. If such a permission setting is desired, you can use the octal version instead, which in this case would be 375. Also, any other kind of permission string where the owner has read permissions (for example r-x------ or r--r--r--) will work fine.</p>

	<title>Howl DDL</title>
	
<p>Howl supports a subset of the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hive/LanguageManual/DDL">Hive Data Definition Language</a>. For those commands that are supported, any variances are noted below.</p>	

<section>
	<title>Create/Drop/Alter Table</title>
<p><strong>CREATE TABLE</strong></p>	

<p>The STORED AS clause in Hive is:</p>
<source>
[STORED AS file_format]
file_format:
  : SEQUENCEFILE
  | TEXTFILE
  | RCFILE     
  | INPUTFORMAT input_format_classname OUTPUTFORMAT output_format_classname
</source>

<p>The STORED AS clause in Howl is:</p>	
<source>
[STORED AS file_format]
file_format:
  : RCFILE     
  | INPUTFORMAT input_format_classname OUTPUTFORMAT output_format_classname 
                   INPUTDRIVER input_driver_classname OUTPUTDRIVER output_driver_classname
</source>

<p>Note the following:</p>	
<ul>
<li>CREATE TABLE command must contain a "STORED AS" clause; if it doesn't it will result in an exception containing message "STORED AS specification is either incomplete or incorrect."  <br></br> <br></br>
<table>
	<tr>
	<td><p>In this release, Howl supports only reading PigStorage formated text files and only writing RCFile formatted files. Therefore, for this release, the command must contain a "STORED AS RCFILE" clause. </p></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br></br>
</li>
<li>For partitioned tables, partition columns can only be of type String. 
</li>
<li>CLUSTERED BY clause is not supported. If provided error message will contain "Operation not supported. Howl doesn't allow Clustered By in create table." 
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>CREATE TABLE AS SELECT</strong></p>
<p>Not supported. Throws an exception with message "Operation Not Supported". </p>	
<p><strong>CREATE TABLE LIKE</strong></p>
<p>Not supported. Throws an exception with message "Operation Not Supported". </p>	
<p><strong>DROP TABLE</strong></p>
<p>Supported. Behavior the same as Hive.</p>	


<!-- ==================================================================== -->
<p><strong>ALTER TABLE</strong></p>
<source>
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD partition_spec [ LOCATION 'location1' ] partition_spec [ LOCATION 'location2' ] ...
 partition_spec:
  : PARTITION (partition_col = partition_col_value, partition_col = partiton_col_value, ...)
</source>
<p>Note the following:</p>	
<ul>
<li>Allowed only if TABLE table_name was created using Howl. Else, throws an exception containing error message "Operation not supported. Partitions can be added only in a table created through Howl. It seems table tablename was not created through Howl" 
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->	
<p><strong>ALTER TABLE FILE FORMAT</strong></p>
<source>
ALTER TABLE table_name SET FILEFORMAT file_format 
</source>
<p>Note the following:</p>	
<ul>
<li>Here file_format must be same as the one described above in CREATE TABLE. Else, throw an exception "Operation not supported. Not a valid file format." </li>
<li>CLUSTERED BY clause is not supported. If provided will result in an exception "Operation not supported." </li>
</ul>

<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->	
<p><strong>ALTER TABLE Change Column Name/Type/Position/Comment </strong></p>
<source>
ALTER TABLE table_name CHANGE [COLUMN] col_old_name col_new_name column_type [COMMENT col_comment] [FIRST|AFTER column_name]
</source>
<p>Not supported. Throws an exception with message "Operation Not Supported". </p>

<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->	
<p><strong>ALTER TABLE Add/Replace Columns</strong></p>
<source>
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD|REPLACE COLUMNS (col_name data_type [COMMENT col_comment], ...)
</source>
<p>Note the following:</p>	
<ul>
<li>ADD Columns is allowed. Behavior same as of Hive. </li>
<li>Replace column is not supported. Throws an exception with message "Operation Not Supported". </li>
</ul>

<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->	
<p><strong>ALTER TABLE TOUCH</strong></p>
<source>
ALTER TABLE table_name TOUCH;
ALTER TABLE table_name TOUCH PARTITION partition_spec;
</source>
<p>Not supported. Throws an exception with message "Operation Not Supported". </p>
