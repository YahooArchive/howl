/**
 *  An interface to manages records, which are uninterpreted blobs of data.

 *  The set of record operations is simple: fetch, insert, update and delete.
 *  Each record is identified using a "rowid" and contains a byte[] data block.
 *  Rowids are returned on inserts and you can store them someplace safe
 *  to be able to get  back to them.  Data blocks can be as long as you wish,
 *  and may have lengths different from the original when updating.
