/**
 * A bucket is a placeholder for multiple (key, value) pairs.  Buckets
 * are used to store collisions (same hash value) at all levels of an
 * H*tree.
 *
 * There are two types of buckets: leaf and non-leaf.
 *
 * Non-leaf buckets are buckets which hold collisions which happen
 * when the H*tree is not fully expanded.   Keys in a non-leaf buckets
 * can have different hash codes.  Non-leaf buckets are limited to an
 * arbitrary size.  When this limit is reached, the H*tree should create
 * a new Directory page and distribute keys of the non-leaf buckets into
 * the newly created Directory.
 *
 * A leaf bucket is a bucket which contains keys which all have
 * the same <code>hashCode()</code>.  Leaf buckets stand at the
 * bottom of an H*tree because the hashing algorithm cannot further
 * discriminate between different keys based on their hash code.
