/**
 * Base class for all User-defined Aggregation Function (UDAF) classes.
 * 
 * UDAF classes are REQUIRED to inherit from this class.
 * 
 * Required for a UDAF class: 1. Implement the init() method, which reset the
 * status of the aggregation function. 2. Implement a single method called
 * "aggregate" that returns boolean. The method should always return "true" on
 * valid inputs, or the framework will throw an Exception. Following are some
 * examples: public boolean aggregate(double a); public boolean aggregate(int
 * b); public boolean aggregate(double c, double d); 3. Implement a single
 * method called "evaluate" that returns the FINAL aggregation result.
 * "evaluate" should never return "null" or an Exception will be thrown.
 * Following are some examples. public int evaluate(); public long evaluate();
 * public double evaluate(); public Double evaluate(); public String evaluate();
 * 
 * Optional for a UDAF class (by implementing these 2 methods, the user declares
 * that the UDAF support partial aggregations): 1. Implement a single method
 * called "evaluatePartial" that returns the PARTIAL aggregation result.
 * "evaluatePartial" should never return "null" or an Exception will be thrown.
 * 2. Implement a single method called "aggregatePartial" that takes a PARTIAL
 * aggregation result and returns a boolean. The method should always return
 * "true" on valid inputs, or the framework will throw an Exception.
 * 
 * Following are some examples: public int evaluatePartial(); public boolean
 * aggregatePartial(int partial);
 * 
 * public String evaluatePartial(); public boolean aggregatePartial(String
 * partial);
